Try to follow these guidelines when writing your issue. They will make it easier for me to help you:
1) Make your title descriptive of your bug, feature, or idea.
2) If you have a bug, list the steps to reproduce it, and note which platform you experienced it on (Steam or GOG).
3) If you have a suggestion/feature please describe the desired behavior or feature in detail and why you want it. If it is non trivial, or if you think it will help describe it, then try to include diagrams, mock up images, or pseudo code. 
4) Include any other information you think is pertinent.

Thank you.
